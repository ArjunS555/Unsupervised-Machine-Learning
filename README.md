# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
Clustering E-Commerce customers based on their Recency, Frequency, Monetary Values so that they can be targeted with customized Marketing Strategies. 
Our data set does not have Dependent and Independent variables.
To achieve our objectives, we must segment the customers into different clusters based on their RFM scores.
The variables used for RFM scores  are:
Recency- Date of Purchase, Customer ID 
Frequency - Invoice No, Date of Purchase
Monetary values - Customer ID, Mean value of Sum of total purchases made by unique customer ID.
Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used to cluster the customers.

Recency is the number of days since last purchase was made by a unique customer ID.
FREQUENCY is the total number of transactions made by the unique customer ID.
MONETARY VALUE is the total amount that the customer has  spent across all transactions.
